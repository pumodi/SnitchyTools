#SnitchyTools
============

A Mac application to help Quidditch TD's run tournaments

## ToDo
* Create App Icon
* Remove "Snitch Returns to Pitch" and "Stop Clock (Seeker Floor Continues)"
* Replace Double Yellow card in IP box with Blue Card
* Fix Clock persistence (clock stops/starts in weird situations and will sometimes run continuously when previously stopped)

## Wishlist
* Local Database to store Tournament Data
* Remote Database
* Robust Statistics System, complete with graphs
* CSV Exporting
* Google Drive Integration
* iPad Companion App

### Snitchkeeper
